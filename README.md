# psPush
Basic popup and webpage pushing script for Atera

# READ ME #
 Atera does not allow scripts to be shared with variables,
 so you'll need to add those yourself in the Atera scripting page - very easy! :)

 1) Create the variables below in Atera:

            Popup_Tile
      
            Message_Text
      
            Website

 2) In the ATERA VARIABLE CONFIG area in the script, remove the QQQ's from each line.

 3) That's it!

 # IMPORTANT #
 Website pushing requires https:// or http://

 Since Atera requires the variable to be set, as long as you
 enter five or less characters, no site will be pushed.
